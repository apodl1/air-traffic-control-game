6.3.23: Due to the university exam week and extracurricular activities I did not have time to start the project this week. Fortunately I did not plan too much work for this period and made significant progress on the needed alorithms in the planning phase, so the overall project is still well on time.
20.3.23: Due to busyness with other courses and teekkarispeksi the project has received less attention than planned. I have however progressed well with map generation, building a groundwork and moving on onto procedural generation. It should be done by the end of the week. This pushes the work on the Airplane-class forward, but this should not be a problem.
