6.3.23: Due to the university exam week and extracurricular activities I did not have time to start the project this week. Fortunately I did not plan too much work for this period and made significant progress on the needed alorithms in the planning phase, so the overall project is still well on time.
20.3.23: Due to busyness with other courses and teekkarispeksi the project has received less attention than planned. I have however progressed well with map generation, building a groundwork and moving on onto procedural generation. It should be done by the end of the week. This pushes the work on the Airplane-class forward, but this should not be a problem.
03.04.23: The map generation algroithm is completed and confirmed working with simple tests. I have also started work on airplane-side of things. The past weeks have been busy however, and overall work is late by a week or two. Thi week is however much less busy with other courses, and I should be able to put in the missing ~20h during the spring holiday.
